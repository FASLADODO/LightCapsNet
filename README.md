# LightCapsuleNet

A Matlab implementation of CapsNet in the paper:   
[Sara Sabour, Nicholas Frosst, Geoffrey E Hinton. Dynamic Routing Between Capsules. NIPS 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09829)

This project is in testing stage.

The network is implemented in the hard way. The back pro

At this time the MLP network is implemented in the tests. The function of 'dynamic routing' is still in development.

Collaborations and contributions are very welcome.
