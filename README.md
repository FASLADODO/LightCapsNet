# LightCapsNet(testing stage)

A Matlab implementation of CapsNet in the paper:   
[Sara Sabour, Nicholas Frosst, Geoffrey E Hinton. Dynamic Routing Between Capsules. NIPS 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09829)

The network is implemented in the hard way. The back propagation is first derived by hand and then implemented.

At this time the an MLP capsule network and CNN capsult network is implemented in the tests. 
The 'dynamic routing' is still in development. One simple example is provided and it is likely to be a new hardware killer. 

Collaborations and contributions are very welcome.
