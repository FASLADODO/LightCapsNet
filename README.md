# LightCapsNet(testing stage)

A Matlab implementation of CapsNet in the paper:   
[Sara Sabour, Nicholas Frosst, Geoffrey E Hinton. Dynamic Routing Between Capsules. NIPS 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09829)

The network is implemented in the hard way. The back propagation is first derived by hand and then implemented.

At this time the an MLP capsule network and CNN capsult network is implemented in the tests. 
The 'dynamic routing' is still in development. I have provided its source code in the CoreModules/layers directory but it is not working as it should yet. 

Collaborations and contributions are very welcome.
